# Data Structures

For Rust specific visualization of the metadata for heap containers (e.g. Box, Vec, Rc, Arc, Cell) checkout  https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q-c7UAyrUlM-eZyTo1pd8SZ0qwA_wYxmPZVOQkoDmH4/edit#slide=id.p

## Overview

This will be more filled out upon completion with links.  For now go to the [src](src/data_structures/) directory to see progress.

- Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Stack
- Array
- Queue
- Binary Tree (B+ Tree)
- Binary Search Tree
- Heap
- Hash Table
- Graph
- Trie

## Big O Notation

Each of these has a worst case scenario for runtime or memory usage scaled with respect to the size of the input data.  Below is a table of data structures and their Big O runtimes in order of fastest to slowest.

| Data Structure | Big 0 (worst case)
| -------------- | --------- 
| Array | O(1) 
| Linked List | O(1) 
| Stack | O(1) 
| Queue | O(1) 
| Hash Table | O(1)
| Binary Search Tree | O(log n)
| B+ Tree | O(log n)
| Heap | O(log n)
| Hash Table | O(n)
| Graph | O(n^2)
| Trie | O(n)
